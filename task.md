🔴Fake or Real?

This image shows how tools from image processing and statistics can be used to distinguish a real photo from one generated by AI. The method is based on the principle that real images reflect the physical properties of the environment, while fake images only imitate statistical patterns learned from training data.
In this approach, the first step is to extract only the brightness of each image, meaning the color information is removed and only the intensity of each pixel is kept.

This is done because brightness gradients, which are the sudden changes in brightness between neighboring pixels, are highly sensitive to the physical structure of an object and the way light interacts with it. In real images, these gradients form sharp and consistent edges that align with the three dimensional structure of the object. For example, the edges of an airplane’s body, the shadows created by its wings and the fine surface details all appear in the gradient map as clear and logically structured features.

But in generated images, AI models are usually unable to perfectly replicate these physical interactions. The gradients in such images tend to be less organized, the edges are less sharp and less consistent, and sometimes unnatural or random patterns appear in regions that should be smooth. These differences become clearly visible when looking at the gradient representation.

To convert these visual observations into a measurable indicator, a statistical analysis is used which is the computation of a covariance matrix. For each pixel, two values are extracted. One represents the horizontal change in brightness and the other represents the vertical change. Together, these two values form a two dimensional vector.

All of these vectors from across the image are collected in a matrix. By applying statistical operations to this matrix, a covariance matrix is computed. This covariance matrix acts as a statistical summary that shows how the horizontal and vertical brightness variations across the entire image are correlated and how they are distributed.

In real images, this covariance matrix displays consistent and predictable patterns that align with the physical structure of the object. In fake images, the covariance matrix tends to show less organization, weaker correlations or even randomness because generative models cannot accurately reproduce real world interactions between light and surfaces.
